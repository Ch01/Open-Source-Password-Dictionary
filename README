This project was conceived on irc.freenode.net #theblackmatrix

It is designed to be a open source community driven password database that
resides on the web. The motivation for contribution will be the ability to
dynamically generate reliable dictionary lists with pre-set parameters.

Depends:
	- PHP (>= 5.3.6)
		* Using PDO driver.
	- MySQL (>= 5.1)
	- HTML5/CSS

File structure can be found in ./FILES.
Database structure(s) can be found in app/config/sql/*.

Active discussions take place in a few places:
    - On IRC, at irc.freenode.net#theblackmatrix
    - In Google Groups at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theblackmatrix-password-dictionary

A beta fork of the project can be viewed at http://ospwdict.markizano.net/
Please note: This is an active development fork of the project from https://github.com/markizano/,
so pages may not always render. Ping markizano!irc.freenode.net if it's unavailable and you'd like to view a
working copy of the project.
~ Currently working on /assets/js/* (as of 2012-03-29)

== Active Development Points:

If you'd like to contribute to the project, some points of interest include the following:

    - Need to import Zend_Db (or some PDO front) to bring a cleaner OOP setup.
    - Need to complete the design of the data to be used by the system.
